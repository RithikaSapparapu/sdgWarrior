## 1. Description of the game
### Idea and Uniqueness
Test players’ awareness of Sustainable Development Goals in the form of question pop-ups.
The game smoothly tries to implant the ideologies of SDGs by letting players immerse themselves in the fantasy 3D simulated game environment.
### Game Play
On clicking “PLAY GAME” on the start menu starts the game.
Players will have 5 lives and full recovery(of all lives) can be done using health crates.
Loss of single life happens when CHOMPER(enemy) attacks you.
Chomper can be taken down in a single hit(left mouse click).
Falling into an acid pool leads to immediate death(loss of all remaining lives).
### Reward system
Going near crystals triggers question pop-ups, answering correctly increases the score.
As of now, there are no negative points on wrong answers, since our aim is to make players explore the game.
